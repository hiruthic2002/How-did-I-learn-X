# How did I learn C++

#### Story:

    So C++ was the first programming language I have learnt, along with that I also learnt
    how computer work. It was hard at first As I only stuided the theory stuffs and
    practiced nothing. Then I reallised my mistake and started code.

    First I copy the code by looking at it and typing it insetead of Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v.
    Then I play with the code, make mistakes, search google about the error and correct
    those mistakes. The semicolon can give real headach in C++, that is the first thing
    I have learnt it in C++.

    What I have learnt in this process was that, reading text books is studing and practing
    the stuffs we stuided is learning. And programing language should be learnt not studied.
